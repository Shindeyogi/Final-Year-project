# Final-Year-project
The Group Project 
Our final year project is a web-based restaurant management system that provides a centralized platform for food ordering and table booking. The system is designed to integrate multiple restaurant websites, allowing users to access all available options in one place.
The technical architecture of the system is based on a client-server model, where the user interacts with a front-end web interface, while the back-end server manages the business logic and data storage. The server is built using a combination of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP or any other server-side language.
The system integrates with external APIs provided by the participating restaurants to provide up-to-date information on menu items, prices, and availability. The system also includes a payment gateway to facilitate secure and hassle-free online payments.
The system provides two main functionalities: food ordering and table booking. For food ordering, users can browse the menu items, select the items they wish to order, and place the order. The order is then processed and sent to the restaurant for preparation. The user is notified of the estimated time of delivery or pickup.
For table booking, the user can select the desired restaurant, date, time, and number of guests. The system checks the availability of tables in real-time and confirms the reservation. The user is then provided with a confirmation email and SMS with the details of the reservation.
The system also includes features such as order history, user profile management, and restaurant management tools. These tools allow restaurant owners to manage their menus, update prices, and track orders.
Overall, Our project aims to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and convenient platform for food ordering and table booking, while also helping restaurants to streamline their operations and increase customer satisfaction
